'''
Rogue stealth builds while not attacking and slower while moving
Once you have built max stealth, you will be able to perform a Stealth Strike
Rogue stealth only reduces when you attack, it does not reduce while moving
The higher your rogue stealth the higher your rogue damage and crit
Having more stealth regeneration slightly decreases the damage bonus from stealth
This is offset by you being able to use stealth strikes far more often
